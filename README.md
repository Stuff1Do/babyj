# compiler-proj

A custom programming language compiler project (in development) written in Python. This repo contains my work-in-progress compiler implementation, including parsing, type checking, and code generation components. 


## Learning Resources
This compiler is loosely inspired by 
 * “Crafting Interpreters” by Bob Nystrom

 * “Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools” (the Dragon Book)

 * Online tutorials on ANTLR / LLVM

## Roadmap / TODO
 Complete type checker
 Build IR and write optimizer
 Target LLVM or custom bytecode
 Improve README with usage examples
 Add code examples and compiler demo
